  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
  <h5>Are my credit card details secure?</h5>
  <p>Yes, absolutely. We encrypt your credit card details before they are sent anywhere. Further to that, your internet connection is encrypted using SSL Encryption. Think of it as putting your credit card details into a box, locking that, putting it in another box, and also locking that. We never transmit the keys needed to unlock these locks because we implement the RSA Public Key Cryptography Standard which is widespread in the eCommerce Industry and Internet at large.</p>
  <p>Moreover, we don't store your credit card details. A Payment Card Industry gateway provider who is compliant to the Data Security Standard handles transactions directly with your credit card provider e.g. Visa, MasterCard. That way if our systems are ever broken into, your credit card details are nowhere to be seen.</p>


  <h5>Do you sell my personal data to any other 3rd parties like advertisers?</h5>
  <p>Nope. No way. We. just. sell. tickets.</p>

  <h5>Should I print out my tickets?</h5>
  <p>You don't need to but you can if you really want to. Tiklet.me events do not need tickets to be printed out in order to gain entry to the event. Your tickets are automatically added to the doorlist of the event. Simply line up to the event and bring with you suitable ID (driver's licence, passport or similar) to verify your purchase. Please be aware that student cards, concession cards, bus passes or similar are NOT suitable and will not enable us to verify identity. Thems the rules.</p>

  <h5>If the event is cancelled, do you issue refunds to the show?</h5>
  <p>Yes. If the event happens to get cancelled you will be reimbursed any moneys spent on tickets for the event cancelled. Refunds can take up to a week to be transferred however. If they take longer, please reach out and contact us at admin@tiklet.me and we will address the problem further.</p>


  <h5>Can I view my orders anywhere?</h5>
  <p>Yes. Simply log into your account using your email address and password, select the Account tab at the top of the page and click on 'Your Orders'. You can also find your orders in your email account.</p>

  <h5>Can I change my credit card details at anytime?</h5>
  <p>Yes. Again just log into your account, select the Account tab at the top of the page and click on 'Billing Details'. There you will be able to change your credit card details, submit them for verification and consequently update you account to use the new credit card details.</p>

  <h5>Is there a mobile friendly version of your website?</h5>
  <p>Yes. It is automatically built into the codebase. The website detects what type of device you are using to view it and delivers content optimized specifically for that device. Pretty cool hey.</p>


  <h5>I'm viewing your site using an older mobile device. Your site seems buggy; I can't register or login to my account. What's going wrong?</h5>
  <p>We recommend that you update the phone's stock standard browser: download a free browser like Firefox from your appstore and use that instead. Older phones running older stock browsers are extremely restricted and not suited for this website. If you are using Android 4.0 or greater and are experiencing problems, download Chrome for Android. It's awesome and is what you would usually expect from a browser. If you're using an Android version below Android 4.0, go download Firefox from Google Play, it's just as good.</p>

  <h5>Do you have an iPhone or Android app I can download?</h5>
  <p>Not yet. They're both in active development and nearing the point of release.</p>

  <h5>Can I cancel my account with Tiklet.me?</h5>
  <p style="display:inline;">You can but please remember that if you ever want to buy tickets again through Tiklet.me you will have to register again. Send an email to <h5 style="display:inline;">admin@tiklet.me</h5> and we will sort it out for you.</p>
