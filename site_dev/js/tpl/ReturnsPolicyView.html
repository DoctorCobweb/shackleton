  <h3>Returns Policy</h3>
  <p>Because your tickets are entirely digital you will never truly lose them. They will always be on Tiklet.me's system. If you have chosen to print out your tickets please remember that they will also be available on the doorlist. Just bring suitable ID (driver's licence, passport or similar) and present it at the entry to the event.</p>
  <p>In the case of the event being cancelled, all tickets purchased for the event through Tiklet.me will be duly refunded to all respective Tiklet.me purchasers.</p>
  <p>We do not refund tickets if you can no longer go to the event. At the very least, try to recoup your cost by selling them to friends who would dig the gig.</p>
  <p>Theft of tickets is mostly eliminated in the physical sense since we're an entirely digital company. However, if there is digital theft of the ticket we can easily reissue new digital tickets and invalidate the stolen ones.</p>
  <p style="display:inline;">If your question regarding a return has not been addressed here, please contact us directly at <h5 style="display:inline;">admin@tiklet.me</h5> and we can take it from there.</p>
