  <h3>Ticket Types</h3>

  <h5>E-Ticket</h5>
  <p>An E-Ticket is automatically added to the doorlist for the event purchased. A copy of the E-Ticket is emailed to you as a PDF attachment for reference. All you need to do to gain entry to the event is bring suitable ID (drivers licence, passport etc) to provide Tiklet.me proof of your purchase. You can also however print out your PDF copy of the ticket but please think about the environment when doing so as it is not entirely necessary as your E-Ticket is already on the doorlist.</p>
    
  <h5>Mobile Ticket: iPhone Passbook Pass</h5>
  <p>If you are using an iPhone running iOS 6 or greater to purchase tickets you will, in addition to receiving the E-Ticket, receive an option to import your ticket directly onto your phone's Passbook App. It is exactly like the E-Ticket, it contains the same information, except it lives in your Passbook App. You can use this ticket to gain entry to the event by simply going into your Passbook App and then selecting the relevant ticket to display it.</p>
