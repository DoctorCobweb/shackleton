    <h3>About Shackleton Ticketing</h3>

    <h5>What</h5>
    <p>We are a modern digital, online ticketing company. By operating entirely in the digital realm, Tiklet.me is able to greatly reduce any costs which are traditionally associated with other solutions out there. This allows us to focus on delivering a more useable, secure and optimized experience to you that is available across a widespread number of devices. Tiklet.me absolutely cares about how it looks on a desktop, mobile and tablet device. There is no excuse for delivering a bad user experience just because you happen to be using a smartphone as opposed to a more traditional desktop computer.</p>

    <h5>How</h5>
    <p>Tiklet.me is an entirely cloud based solution.</p>
    <p>This means there is a high availabilty, web scale performant distributed computing service always running under the hood to power Tiklet.me. If you sit down and think about it for a while, online ticketing tasks often display extremely high demands, on very short timescales, with purchase requests originating from vast, disparate physical locations using numerous types of devices. What is needed is a highly scalable infrastructure built for real-time distributed communication, and one which is secure, reliable and always on.</p>
    <p>...The perfect description of a problem best solved using cloud computing.</p>

    <h5>Who</h5>
    <p>We are a core technology group who are focused on providing software solutions primarily to the Music Industry. There's a lot of work to be done but by using modern day, agile development practices coupled with software frameworks specifically chosen to suit the problem at hand, we believe it can be done.</p>
