  <h3>Ticket Types</h3>
  <h5>E-Ticket</h5>
  <p>An E-Ticket is automatically added to the doorlist for the event purchased. A copy of
 the E-Ticket is emailed to you as a PDF attachment for reference. All you need to do to g
ain entry to the event is bring suitable ID (drivers licence, passport etc) to provide Tik
let.me proof of your purchase. You can also however print out your PDF copy of the ticket
but please think about the environment when doing so as it is not entirely necessary as yo
ur E-Ticket is already on the doorlist.</p>

  <h5>Mobile Ticket: iPhone Passbook Pass</h5>
  <p>If you are using an iPhone using iOS 6 or greater to purchase tickets you will, in ad
dition to receiving the E-Ticket, receive an option to import your ticket directly onto yo
ur phone's Passbook App. It is exactly like the E-Ticket except it lives in the Passbook A
pp. You can use this ticket to gain entry to the event by simply going into the Passbook A
pp and selecting it to display it.</p>






  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
  <h5>Are my credit card details secure?</h5>
  <p>Yes, absolutely. We encrypt your credit card details before they are sent anywhere. F
urther to that, your internet connection is encrypted using SSL Encryption. Think of it as
 putting your credit card details into a box, locking that, putting it in another box, and
 also locking that. We never transmit the keys needed to unlock these locks because we imp
lement the RSA Public Key Cryptography Standard which is widespread in the eCommerce Indus
try and Internet at large.</p>
  <p>Moreover, we don't store your credit card details. A Payment Card Industry gateway pr
ovider who is compliant to the Data Security Standard handles transactions directly with y
our credit card provider e.g. Visa, MasterCard. That way if our systems are ever broken in
to, your credit card details are nowhere to be seen and the intruder is left with their pr
overbial 'thing' in their hand.</p>


  <h5>Do you sell my personal data to any other 3rd parties like advertisers?</h5>
  <p>Nope. No way. We. just. sell. tickets.</p>

  <h5>Should I print out my tickets?</h5>
  <p>You don't need to but you can if you really want to. Tiklet.me events do not need tic
kets to be printed out in order to gain entry to the event. Your tickets are automatically
 added to the doolist of the event. Simply line up to the event and bring with you suitabl
e ID (driver's licence, passport or similar) to verify your purchase. Please be aware that
 student cards, concession cards, bus passes or similar are NOT suitable and will not allo
w you verify you tickets on the doorlist. Thems the rules.</p>

  <h5>If the event is cancelled, do you issue refunds to the show?</h5>
  <p>Yes. If the event happens to get cancelled you will be reinbursed any moneys spent on
 tickets for the event cancelled. Refunds can take up to a week to be transferred however.
 If they take longer, please reach out and contact us at admin@tiklet.me and we will addre
ss the problem further.</p>


  <h5>Can I view my orders anywhere?</h5>
  <p>Yes. Simply log into your account using your email address and password, select the A
ccount tab at the top of the page and click on 'Your Orders'.</p>

  <h5>Can I change my credit card details at anytime?</h5>
  <p>Yes. Again just log into your account, select the Account tab at the top of the page
and click on 'Billing Details'. There you will be able to change your credit card details,
 submit them for verification and consequently update you account to use the new credit ca
rd details.</p>

  <h5>Is there a mobile friendly version of your website?</h5>
  <p>Yes. It is automatically built into the codebase. The website detects what type of de
vice you are using to view it and delivers content optimized specifically for that device.
 Pretty cool hey.</p>


  <h5>I'm viewing your site using a mobile device. Your site seems buggy, I can't register or login to my account. What's going wrong?!</h5>
  <p>We recommend that you update the phone's stock standard browser: download a free brow
ser like Firefox from your appstore and use that instead. Older phones running older stock
 browsers are extremely restricted and not suited for this website. If you are using Andro
id 4.0 or greater and are experiencing problems, download Chrome for Android. It's awesome
 and is what you would usually expect from a browser. If you're using an Android version b
elow Android 4.0, go download Firefox from Google Play, it's just as good.</p>

  <h5>Do you have an iPhone or Android app I can download?</h5>
  <p>Not yet. They're both in active development and nearing the point of release.</p>





  <h3>Returns Policy</h3>
  <p>Because your tickets are entirely digital you will never truly lose them. They will a
lways be on Tiklet.me's system. If you have chosen to print out your tickets please rememb
er that they will also be available on the doorlist. Just bring suitable ID (driver's lice
nce, passport or similar) and present it at the entry to the event.</p>
  <p>In the case of the event being cancelled, all tickets purchased for the event through Tiklet.me will be duly refunded to all respective Tiklet.me purchasers.</p>
  <p>We do not refund tickets if you can no longer go to the event. At the very least, try to recoup your cost by selling them to friends who would dig the gig.</p>
  <p>Theft of tickets is mostly eliminated in the physical sense since we're an entirely digital company. However, if there is digital theft of the ticket we can easily reissue new digital tickets and invalidate the stolen ones.</p>
  <p style="display:inline;">If your question regarding a return has not been addressed here, please contact us di
rectly at <h5 style="display:inline;">admin@tiklet.me</h5> and we can take it from there.</p>

is used from there on afterwards.</p>
